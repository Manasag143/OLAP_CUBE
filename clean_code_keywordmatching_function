            Your Goal is to generate a precise single line cube query for the user query delimited by ####.


            Instructions:            
            - Generate a single-line Cube query without line breaks
            - Include 'as' aliases for all level names in double quotes. alias are always level names.
            - Choose the most appropriate dimensions group names and level from dimensions delimited by $$$$ according to the query.
            - Choose the most appropriate measures group names and level from measures delimited by &&&& according to the query.
            - check the examples to learn about correct syntax, functions and filters which can be used according to the user query requirement.
            - User Query could be a follow up query in a conversation, you will also be provided previous query, dimensions, measures, cube query. Generate the final query including the contexts from conversation as appropriate.

            Formatting Rules:
            - Dimensions format: [Dimension Group Name].[Dimension Level Name] as "Dimension Level Name"
            - Measures format: [Measure Group Name].[Measure Level Name] as "Measure Level Name"
            - Conditions in WHERE clause must be properly formatted with operators
            - For multiple conditions, use "and" "or" operators
            - All string values in conditions must be in single quotes
            - All numeric values should not have leading zeros

New User query: {query}
New Dimensions: {dimensions}
New Measures: {measures}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. START with the base query - it must be preserved exactly as is
2. ONLY ADD/Remove corresponding new dimensions/measures that are specifically requested in the new user query
3. DO NOT remove or modify any existing dimensions or measures unless explicitly requested
4. Keep all existing WHERE clauses, filters, and functions from the base query
5. Only add new conditions if specifically mentioned in the new query
6. Maintain the exact same syntax and formatting as the base query
7. Remove all filters when asked, remove all filters like WHERE clause, Head/Tail, IF, Function, percentage, runningsum
8. Use - TrendNumber:- for year-over-year/period comparisons, TimeBetween:- for data between year range, use TrendNumber and TimeBetween both as mentioned in query
9. Check if the Dimensions and measures relate to the new user query, modify the base query for only those new dimensions/measures specifically mentioned in the new user query
10. When asked to remove, only remove what is asked don't add any measures/dimensions.

Example Approach:
- If base query has dimensions and measures and new query asks to add or remove some dimension or measure, modify the base query for the corresponding dimension and measure only, rest of the base query needs to be preserved.
- If base query has the above mentioned filters like where, Head,  preserve them and only ADD new ones if specifically asked
- If base query has already time ranges and new query is asking new time range forget the previous time range and remove invalidated funtions.
- If base query has an function and the new query ask for the same function we can have both the function
- Try to pick queries answer from <example> if mention

Your task is to Modify the base query while keeping its existing structure and elements intact.
Return only the modified query without any explanations."""
